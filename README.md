I redesigned the hawaiian cuisine restaurant website, Steve's Poké Bar, to practice Sass and CSS grid. ~~Note that I am still working on the project at this moment (Jan 2021) for responsive design and interactive javascript webpages.~~

## Motivation
When I worked at the Steve's Poké Bar, lots of customers complained the menu design was too confusing to order. The primary navigation seemed to have too many options as well. So I decided to redesign the website - mainly on the homepage.
